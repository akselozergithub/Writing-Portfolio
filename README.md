# Public Portfolio
A public repository for my technical writing portfolio.

This portfolio includes papers I wrote for assignments in my linguistics classes in addition to papers I submitted for my application for masters school

## Documents

This portfolio contains six papers
(1) The Emergence of Language and Recursive Thought
(2) Personal Statement MA Linguistics
(3) Quantifier Scope Ambiguity
(4) Review of Rizzi 97 Fine Structure of the Left Periphery
(5) A Distributional Semantics Based on Gesture
(6) Personal Statement MA Linguistics
(7) Can Lambda Calculus Capture Construction Grammar

### (1) The Emergence of Language and Recursive Thought...

In this paper I consider theories on the origin of human language and look for alternative explanations 
of the emergence of grammar outside of the longstanding tradition of generative grammar.

### (2) Personal Statement MA Linguistics...

This is my personal statement for the Master's programs I applied to in linguistics which outlines my current interests in the field.

### (3) Quantifier Scope Ambiguity...

I look at common approaches to dealing with ambiguities in tree structure generation that result from the varying scope of quantifier such as "every", "some", "few", and "all" etc.

### (4) Review of Rizzi 97 Fine Structure of the Left Periphery...

This paper is a review of Rizzi 97's paper on the Left Periphery and deals with the expansion of the complementizer layer.

### (5) A Distributional Semantics Based on Gesture...

In this paper I looked at how gesture could be used to inform modern approaches to natural language processing.

### (6) Can Lambda Calculus Capture Construction Grammar...

Historically, examples inside of Construction Grammar have created problems for generative grammar. This paper presents my humble proposal for the addition of derivation rules inside of lambda calculus that allows for the dynamic creation of new verb senses.
